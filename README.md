Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) is commonly used as a companion species in intercropping systems around the world due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and other benefits it brings. Predicting alfalfa growth stages accurately is essential for an effective farm intercropping management. This study investigates the effects of shade on alfalfa varieties with different dormancy levels. It aims to observe different responses of alfalfaâ€™s vegetative growth under low light conditions. This experiment is designed to  mimic field observations of alfalfa under durum wheat canopy. Morphological traits affected by a shading effect, including leaf area index, plant maximum height, numbers of ramification, leaf count and biomass will be analyzed for different alfalfa varieties with two different dormancy levels. Understanding these dynamics could help re-think alfalfa varietal choices in intercropping systems, potentially reducing herbicide and fertilizer use while enhancing yields. This research addresses a crucial knowledge gap in alfalfa's response to low light conditions. The potential alfalfa development model presented in this study could serve as a framework to integrate post- cutting and light responses in alfalfa mixed croping  models. 


## Data acquisition

The long pocess of gathering,manipulating data goes through tow main parts:

- **Taking photos:** Explain the process of taking this photos 
- **Acquisition:** by using the **SupAgroBot** [scrit](https://github.com/oualidlamrini/SupAgroBot.git) 
  
## Data deployment 
Different tests and statistical models
 
## ANOVA
